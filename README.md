# Reversi - an automated player

## How to run 

```shell
cd reversi\python
python reversi.py
```

Just follow the command menu which will ask you to choose a player type for black and white.  

```sell
Choose a black player type
[1] Random Player
[2] MiniMax (Naive) Player
[3] MiniMax (Alpha Beta Pruning) Player
[4] Manual (Human) Player
Enter [1-4]: 
```

The following sections will explain available player types.

## Random Player

This player randomly chooses a move from the legal moves.

- not very strong
- occasionally hits a very nice move
- very quick to decide the next move
- does not learn from experience

## Manual (aka Human) Player

You can play by entering your move.

```shell
 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 
----------------------------------
0|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
2|   |   |   | @ |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
3|   |   |   | @ | @ |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
4|   |   |   | @ | O |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
5|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
6|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
7|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
----------------------------------
Black: 4 White: 1
[20:42:49] Turn: 2 (ManualPlayer)
Enter a move row, col: 4,2 <= enter your move (row,col)
```

- weak or strong (depends on the mood)
- can be thinking very long but won't forgive the opponent for taking time 
- could/would/should learn from experience

## Minimax Player (aka Naive Minimax)

This player uses the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) decision rule. 

- requires a max_depth parameter (how deep it should think ahead)
  + max_depth = 3 => it's quick but not very strong
  + max_depth = 5 => it's slow and stronger than RandomPlayer

A big max_depth (>5) means you need to wait much longer as it will drill down 
into all the possible moves up to the max depth.

If you are human, you'll need to be doing something else while waiting.  

The below image shows when I was playing while reading an article on wikipedia.

## Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning

This player uses [an improved minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning) logic.

- skips unnecessary tree search (faster than the naive minimax logic)

## Monte Carlo Tree Search

TODO implementing...

This player uses [random (monte carlo) simulation of tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) to find out 
which move will most likely make the player win.

## Deep-Q Network

TODO implementing...

This player uses [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) (from Reinforcement Learning) with Neural Network as the value function.
